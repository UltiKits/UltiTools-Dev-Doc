# Internationalization

UltiTools provides an easy-to-use API for internationalization, allowing you to easily add multilingual support to your plugin.

## Create a language file

Create a `lang` folder in the `resources` folder. Put your plugin language files in it according to your needs.

```json
{
  "test": "测试",
  "test2": "测试2"
}
```

Name the file `zh.json`, where `zh` is the language code.

Language codes can be found [here](http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm).

## Register language

UltiTools needs to know which languages your plugin supports, so you need to register them in the class that inherits `UltiToolsPlugin`.

A simple way is to add `@I18n` and add language codes in the class that inherits `UltiToolsPlugin`:

```java
@I18n({"zh", "en"})
```

Sure, you can also override the `supported()` method and return a `List<String>` containing the language code:

```java
@Override
public List<String> supported() {
    return Arrays.asList("zh", "en");
}
```

## How to use

In the class that inherits `UltiToolsPlugin`, there is an `i18n` method for getting multilingual strings.

```java
String test = i18n("test");

// Output：测试
```

If the string does not exist in the language file, the string itself will be returned.

```java
String test3 = i18n("test3");

// Output：test3
```

::: tip
In the case of only two languages, you can create only one language file, where the key of the key-value pair is the original text and the value is the translation.
